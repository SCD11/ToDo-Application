### General Info

I worked on this when i was learning javascript and css, so i wanted to test what i learned that time.
The goal here was to ensure i can make a web application with enough front end functionality where i can 
add new tasks, mark those are done, remove the tasks which are done or remove all the tasks. This application 
can basically perform all those tasks of a basic todo application. 

### Technologies

While making this application i used, basic vanilla : 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

While learning and working on it, i got a lot of help from the evergreen MDN. So thanks to everyone who worked/working on that. 

### Launch

To test the application you can just go to [this url](https://bitornottobit.github.io/ToDo-Application/) and test on your own. I hope you like it :)

### Future

It's been a while since i worked on it, since now i know backend pretty well enough therefore i am planning to convert it into a node application in future. 

Cheers! feel free to give it a try.
